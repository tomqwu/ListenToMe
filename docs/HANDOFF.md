# Handoff — 2026-10-24

A snapshot for an agent picking up ListenToMe cold. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and
[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) stay the rules; this note is only the state of things on the date above.
Re-check anything time-sensitive (`gh issue list --state open`, `git log`, tags) before acting on it.

## Product state

| Surface | Latest published | State of `main` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iPhone/iPad (TestFlight) | **1.15.0 (32)**, published 2026-10-24, tag `ios-v1.15.0-build32` at `f6e4c72` | Nothing user-visible after `f6e4c72` except the Apple Watch work below. |
| macOS | **1.4.4 (14)**, 2026-09-14, tag `v1.4.4` | **Releases paused on the maintainer's decision.** About 50 commits of Mac work are merged but unreleased; see [CHANGELOG → macOS (unreleased since 1.4.4)](../CHANGELOG.md#macos-unreleased-since-144). Do not start a macOS train yourself; the maintainer calls it. |
| Apple Watch | Not shipped | Built on `main` behind the `WATCH_EMBED` build flag (off; `scripts/ios-testflight.sh` refuses an archive that embeds it). Waits on the maintainer running `SPIKE.md` on a real watch (branch `spike/181-watch-audio`, [#181](https://github.com/tomqwu/ListenToMe/issues/181)), then the Task 20 physical-device acceptance from #193. Status table in the [watch plan](superpowers/plans/2026-10-22-apple-watch-recording.md). |

Recent iOS trains (full text in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)):

- **1.12.0 (29):** speaker names on by default; on-device Automatic language detection (the default).
- **1.13.0 (30):** returning voices, every on-device language, Acknowledgements, Save to folder,
  language re-checks, OpenAI-compatible servers.
- **1.14.0 (31):** Cloud AI presets — OpenAI, Claude (native Messages API), Gemini, DeepSeek,
  OpenRouter, Groq, Mistral, xAI.
- **1.15.0 (32):** Delete all conversations; better Quick grounding and the output-limit notice;
  auto-naming; suggested prompts; export formats with per-line language; the **Deep tab removed on
  iOS** (Quick Summary and Summary remain; saved Deep analyses stay readable as "Earlier deep
  analysis"); domain vocabularies and My terms; semantic search and Ask your history; opt-in saved
  audio; Summarize selection.

## Merged feature follow-up (unreleased)

- #238: all seven presets now select Simplified Chinese terms for `zh`/`zh-Hans` transcription;
  other languages keep English lists. Chinese suggestions work without spaces and use the local
  Chinese embedding when present. Device accuracy acceptance is still pending (#236).

## How work was done

- **One issue per PR**, branched from `main`. Never commit to `main`.
- **Integrate `main` by merge** — never rebase or force-push a pushed branch.
- **Every feature PR got an independent correctness review before merge** (a separate agent reading
  the diff against the issue). It caught real bugs in nearly every PR; keep doing it.
- **Required checks** are the three CI checks: `ListenToMeCore tests + coverage`, `macOS 26 app build`,
  `iOS 26 app build`. Local gates are in AGENTS.md (`make validate-local`, `make lint`, `make e2e`).
- **`make ios-test`** runs on a freshly erased, dedicated simulator (`IOS_DESTINATION=…`), created for
  the run and deleted afterwards, so state from other runs cannot leak in.
- **UI tests use launch fixtures**, never real model downloads: `LISTENTOME_SPEAKER_MODELS_FIXTURE`
  (speaker models) and `LISTENTOME_LANGUAGE_MODEL_FIXTURE` (language-detection model).
- **`iOS/MobileSession.swift` sits near SwiftLint's file/type length limits.** Put new logic in an
  extension file (`iOS/MobileSession+*.swift`) or in `Sources/ListenToMeCore`, not in that file.
- **Releases** follow AGENTS.md and [IOS-RELEASING.md](IOS-RELEASING.md): upload with
  `make ios-testflight IOS_ARCHIVE=<validated.xcarchive> IOS_RELEASE_SOURCE=<commit>`, using the App
  Store Connect API key configured in `~/.config/listentome/testflight.json`. Evidence for each build
  lives in the gitignored `dist/ios-<ver>-build<n>-evidence/`, including `asc-verify-script.py` (the
  App Store Connect check — copy it forward to the next evidence folder).
- **Release archives** for the last three builds are in the gitignored `dist/`:
  `ListenToMe-ios-1.13.0-build30.xcarchive`, `…-1.14.0-build31.xcarchive`,
  `…-1.15.0-build32.xcarchive`. They were moved there from temporary worktrees after upload, so the
  `upload-accepted.json` receipts in the evidence folders still name the old scratch paths. That is
  expected; do not edit the receipts.

## Maintainer preferences

- Cares about **product output**, not PR mechanics. Report what users get and its status
  (merged / candidate / published), briefly.
- **Publish a TestFlight build once requested work is merged and verified** (candidate checks pass);
  don't wait to be asked again (AGENTS.md release trains).
- **iOS is the primary surface.**
- **Nothing leaves the device by default.** Cloud AI is opt-in, with clear "Sends your transcript to …"
  labels. **Never auto-assign a paid hosted model**; the user picks every model.

## Known flaky or order-dependent tests

- [#241](https://github.com/tomqwu/ListenToMe/issues/241): `MobileAITests.testFreshSettingsDefaultToOnDeviceAndPreserveAnyExplicitChoice`
  passes in the full suite and fails in isolation (it depends on UI-test defaults).
- [#176](https://github.com/tomqwu/ListenToMe/issues/176): the iOS UI test bundle is flaky under
  machine load.
- `Tests/ListenToMeCoreTests/SharedQuickLoopTests.swift` has a timing flake; re-run before suspecting
  your change.

## Waiting on the maintainer

- **App Store listing URLs** (privacy policy and support) point at the `codex/app-store-release`
  branch and should be repointed to `main` in App Store Connect. Do not delete that branch until they
  are.
- **Physical-device checks pending for 1.15.0:** vocabulary accuracy, saved audio, Summarize
  selection and Ask your history. 1.15.0 (32) is a TestFlight beta without physical-device
  acceptance; do not call it production-ready.
- **Apple Watch spike** and acceptance, above.
